# MolecularDynamics2025
This repo contains information and materials related to the introductory course to molecular dynamics. The course was conducted between January-April of 2025.

## Getting started
### Requirements
- a laptop or a desktop
- linux OS (please see the **obtaining a _Linux Terminal_** section)

### Obtaining a *Linux Terminal*
#### Context
The terminal in linux is the most powerful feature of the linux (UNIX/GNU) based operating system. Although there is a learning curve, the whole computer can be controlled from a single black (or your colour of choice) screen. </br>
This includes file/folder creation and modifications, navigation into different folders (directories), creating or editing documents, compiling and running programs or even launching apps. </br>
Linux is free, open source and mostly lightweight. This means even very old laptops (lets say even from 2002) can smoothly run a Linux based OS. </br>
This is why Linux the OS of choice in the computational/theoretical science community. Subsequently all the programs developed were primarily focused on running or launching them from the terminal.</br>
We still follow the tradition since using the terminal is very efficient. Therefore everyone needs to obtain a terminal for this course. </br>
</br>
If you already are on the Linux or Mac, you will by default have access to a terminal. If you do not know how to launch one, we will come to it during the lectures.</br>
Windows users need to perform either of the two things below to get an access to a terminal:
- **Linux installtion in a Virtual Machine**: one can create a pseudo-computer inside windows by the use of a software called a Virtual Machine (VM). There are many VMs present. But I will recommend to use [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/) by Oracle. However running a VM inside Windows is quite heavy on the laptop. Therefore, unless your laptop is quite powerful, I would advise against this. However, using linux inside a VM does not require internet, unless something needs to be downloaded.
- **SSH via MobaXterm**: Another way is to obtain access to a linux server and connect to it via SSH. [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/) is an ssh client for windows. I recommend to download the installer version and not the portable version. But I leave this choice to you. Access to a Linux server will be provided and the IP address and the login credentials will be announded the the Google Classroom. </br>
